        <li> Heat 1tbsp of the oil in a large pan and fry the onion for 10min until softened. Turn up the heat, add the

            and fry for 5min until golden. Add the wine and simmer for 5min.</li>
        <li> Stir in the tomatoes and mixed herbs, then crumble in the stock cube and some seasoning. Bring mixture to
            the
            boil; simmer for 5min until thickened. Take off heat.</li>
        <li>
            Next make the white sauce. Heat the remaining oil in a small pan and stir in the flour. Cook for 30sec, then
            take the pan off the heat and gradually whisk in the milk. Return the milk mixture to the heat. Bring to the
            boil, then simmer for 5min, whisking constantly, until thickened and glossy.</li>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 200°C (180°C fan) mark 6. Spoon a third of the mince mixture into the base of a 2 litre (3½
            pint) ovenproof dish. Cover with three lasagne sheets and a little white sauce. Repeat the layering process
            twice more, finishing with a layer of white sauce. Sprinkle over the cheese and cook for 30-35min until
            bubbling
            and golden (cover with foil if browning too quickly). Serve immediately with a salad.</li>
